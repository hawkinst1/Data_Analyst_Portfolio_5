# Data_Analyst_Portfolio_5
A look into some data analytics of a comparative kind using Pokemon stats. For people who don't know much about Pokemon stats this will serve as an easy to digest representation of the different types' standing
compared to one another.

By now I am getting more comfortable with the processes involved and so began by posing questions before I start to do anything with the data.
This will be based on presentation skills where an interactive page is created which looks at each type (by clicking on it) and shows comparisons to other types and the overall average.
